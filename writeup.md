## We used an agile process and grew collaboratively

We used an agile process during our project:

- Held **daily stand ups** at the beginning of the day to plan the day's work and reassess goals.

- Held **retrospectives** at the end of each day allowed us to feedback on our processes and implement changes quickly to allow for smooth teamwork. For example, following our retrospective on Monday we implemented more thorough planning at the beginning of each day and better collaboration before merging.

- Had **honest conversations** in stand ups and retrospectives about what worked and what didn't.

- Used **branches** to work on code and **merged** at appropriate points; group code review before merging to ensure that the group understands the code and any issues were resolved before merging.

- **Used Trello as our work planning tool**; updated these at stand ups and retrospectives.
- agreed on user stories at the beginning of the week to translate the specification into modular features which could be worked on by each pair.

- **Pair programmed** on all features to ensure code quality and joint responsiblity.

- **Rotated pairs** each day in order to allow everyone the best chance to learn from each other and work with different people with different skill sets.

- **Held group discussions** on how to implement important features which would have a wider impact across the code base (e.g. implementation of dates across the app).

- **Used team members to problem solve** e.g.to gain fresh insight on bugs when stuck.

- **Gave feedback** to pairs at the end of each day and at the end of the week to ensure that each person was given the biggest opportunity to learn from the experience

## We can justify the way we worked

- **Language Choice:** We chose to write our app in Ruby over Javascript in order to get a shorter time to MVP. This enabled us to meet our deadline of an MVP by the end of day two ahead of time: we reached MVP by lunchtime on day two.

- **Feature freeze:** We chose earlier in the week to implement a feature freeze at the end of day four, in order to allow time to refactor, tidy up, and clean up any remaining bugs on the final day. This also allowed time for final reflection.

- **Prioritisation:** prioritised user stories in order to ensure that we finished with a well-tested, well-written project. Parked issues we knew would not be achievable within time (or may be achievable but might sacrifice overall quality by taking away time for refactoring/reviewing on the final day). We reviewed these priorities throughout the week.

- **Teamwork:** agreed not to leave a pair stuck on any particular block for too long; called group sessions if stuck on a problem for more than 20 minutes.

## We wrote code that was easy to change

- Wrote classes and methods with **single responsibilities**.

- Ensured code was as readable as possible with **short methods**, **clear naming** of parameters and methods, and using a **linting** tool (rubocop).

- **Refactored** code at the end of the week to ensure as much readability as possible.

- **Group code reviews** before merging; this gave everyone a clear understanding of the overall code base and allowed us to work on changes to the code base easily.

- **Kept readme up to date** to enable code base to be added to in future.

- We used **TDD** throughout, and have **100% test coverage**, ensuring that the code base can be added to without fear of breaking existing features!


## What could have gone better:

- **Setting out ways of working from the start:** spending more time at the beginning of the week thinking about how we would work together could have saved us a lot of time! E.g. setting out a maximum block time before group review.

- **Merges without group reviews:** towards the beginning of the week, we tended to merge branches to the master without the other pairs fully reviewing. This meant that not all of the group was comfortable with how the app worked

- **Spend more time planning on the first day:** for example, our choices early on in the project meant that deploying to Heroku was too difficult within the timeframe. We should have considered the implications of our approach more deeply at the beginning of the week.

- **Nominate a leader for each stand up/retro:** in order to ensure focused conversations, we should have appointed a leader for each conversation (rotating among group members).

- **More detailed code reviews:** we did not do detailed code reviews - this was largely due to time constraints.

## What went great:

- Great sense of team and **teamwork**!

- **Responsive to feedback:** we changed our approach to working together mid week in response to feedback, and had much better teamwork in the second half of the week

- **Good team communication:** regular meetings, feedback and reflections, with honest and open conversations within the team.

- **Equal sense of ownership among all team members:** everyone in the group contributed equally to the project. We all understand our code base.

- **Quality code:** We found it very easy to work on other people's code; well written, easy to change and well tested
